# RECOGNITION-OF-INDIAN-SIGN-LANGUAGE-BY-USING-HAND-GESTURES-AND-SPEECH-GENERATION
## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this project is to help the hearing-impaired people to communicate with normal people by using this automatic Indian Sign Language Recognition System with speech generation. The objective is to propose a model to recognize hand gestures in real time and generate not only a single character but also a whole sentence based on finger spelling method. After the text generation, it is converted to speech for better understanding and also to enhance communication between hearing-Impaired and visually impaired people. To enforce the two-way communication the hand gestures are also generated for the text or sentence, so that it will be useful for hearing impaired persons and the learners of sign language.
## HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
***
The hardware requirements for an Indian Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) System depend on the specific approach and technology used for the recognition task. Here are some general hardware requirements to consider:
* Processor: CPU (minimum i3 processor) or GPU (for speeding u the process).
* Memory: At least 4 GB of RAM is recommended (8GB can be used for better performance).
* Camera: A high-quality camera is required to capture the sign language gestures accurately. A camera with at least 720p resolution is recommended.
* Storage: A large amount of storage space is required to store the datasets and trained models. At least 100 GB of storage space is recommended.
***
## SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS
To develop the ISLR system using machine learning, the following software and packages are required.
* Python: Version 3.10.10 or higher
* Visual Studio: Version 1.77.3 or higher
* Packages Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Tkinter (for GUI window), OpenCV (for image capturing), Pyttsx3 ( for Speech generation)
